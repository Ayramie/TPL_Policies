This Privacy Policy describes how The Prairie Line (“we”, “our”, “the Company”) manages information processed through the Timesheet-Connector integration, which connects our internal Timesheet Application (built in Microsoft Power Apps) to Intuit QuickBooks Online.

This application is used exclusively by employees and authorized personnel of The Prairie Line and is not offered as a public service or commercial product.

1. Information We Collect

Timesheet-Connector itself does not collect or store any information outside of The Prairie Line’s secure Microsoft environment.
All data processed by the connector originates from:

Timesheet entries submitted by Prairie Line employees

Employee and customer data stored within internal Microsoft Dataverse / Power Apps

Payroll and time-tracking data retrieved from QuickBooks Online (read-only)

We do not capture or store any sensitive personal information outside the Company’s systems.

2. How Data Is Used

The Timesheet-Connector integrations are used solely to:

Transfer timesheet data from the internal Timesheet Application to QuickBooks Online

Validate payroll mappings (service items, pay types, overtime, etc.)

Synchronize work hours, customer assignments, compensation data, and payroll references

Support internal payroll processing and accounting operations

No data is used for marketing, analytics, or any purpose unrelated to payroll and timesheet processing.
